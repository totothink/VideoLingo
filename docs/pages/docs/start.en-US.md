# 🚀 Getting Started

## 📋 API Preparation
This project requires the use of large language models, WhisperX, and TTS. Multiple options are provided for each component. **Please read the configuration guide carefully 😊**
### 1. **Obtain API_KEY for Large Language Models**:

| Recommended Model | Recommended Provider | base_url | Price | Effect |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|:-----|:---------|
| claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 (default) | [Yunwu API](https://yunwu.zeabur.app/register?aff=TXMB) | https://yunwu.zeabur.app | ¥15 / 1M tokens (1/10 of official price) | 🤩 |

⚠️ Warning: The prompt involves multi-step thinking chains and complex JSON formats. Models other than Claude 3.5 Sonnet are prone to errors. The cost for a one-hour video is about ¥7.

> Note: Yunwu API also supports OpenAI's tts-1 interface, which can be used in the dubbing step.

<details>
<summary>How to get an API key from Yunwu API?</summary>

1. Click the link for the recommended provider above
2. Register an account and recharge
3. Create a new API key on the API key page
4. For Yunwu API, make sure to check `Unlimited Quota`, select the `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` model, and it is recommended to choose the `Pure AZ 1.5x` channel. If you need to use OpenAI for dubbing, also check the `tts-1` model
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use other models?</summary>

- ✅ Supports OAI-Like API interfaces, but you need to change it yourself in the Streamlit sidebar.
- ⚠️ However, other models (especially small models) have weak ability to follow instructions and are very likely to report errors during translation, which is strongly discouraged.
</details>

### 2. **Prepare Replicate Token** (Only when using whisperXapi ☁️)

VideoLingo uses WhisperX for speech recognition, supporting both local deployment and cloud API. If you don't have a GPU or just want to quickly experience it, you can use the cloud API and the one-click easy package.

#### Comparison of options:
| Option | Disadvantages |
|:-----|:-----|
| **whisperX 🖥️** | • Install CUDA 🛠️<br>• Download model 📥<br>• High VRAM requirement 💾 |
| **whisperXapi ☁️** | • Requires VPN 🕵️‍♂️<br>• Visa card 💳<br>• **Poor Chinese effect** 🚫 |

<details>
<summary>How to obtain the token</summary>
Register at [Replicate](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens), bind a Visa card payment method, and obtain the token. **Or join the QQ group to get a free test token from the group announcement**
</details>

### 3. **TTS API**
VideoLingo provides multiple TTS integration methods. Here's a comparison (skip this if you're only translating without dubbing):

| TTS Option | Advantages | Disadvantages | Chinese Effect | Non-Chinese Effect |
|:---------|:-----|:-----|:---------|:-----------|
| 🎙️ OpenAI TTS | Realistic emotion | Chinese sounds like a foreigner | 😕 | 🤩 |
| 🔊 Azure TTS (Recommended) | Natural effect | Inconvenient recharge | 🤩 | 😃 |
| 🎤 Fish TTS  | Sounds like a real local | Limited official models | 😂 | 😂 |
| 🗣️ GPT-SoVITS (Testing) | Strongest voice cloning | Currently only supports Chinese and English, requires GPU for model inference, configuration requires relevant knowledge | 🏆 | 🚫 |

- For OpenAI TTS, we recommend using [Yunwu API](https://yunwu.zeabur.app/register?aff=TXMB), make sure to check the `tts-1` model;
- **Azure TTS test keys can be obtained in the QQ group announcement** or you can register and recharge yourself on the [official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/ai-services/speech-service/get-started-text-to-speech?tabs=windows%2Cterminal&pivots=programming-language-python);
- For Fish TTS, please register yourself on the [official website](https://fish.audio/zh-CN/go-api/) (10 USD free credit)

<details>
<summary>How to choose an OpenAI voice?</summary>

You can find the voice list on the [official website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options), such as `alloy`, `echo`, `nova`, etc. Modify `openai_tts.voice` in `config.yaml` to change the voice.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to choose an Azure voice?</summary>

It is recommended to listen and choose the voice you want in the [online experience](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery), and find the corresponding code for that voice in the right-hand code, such as `zh-CN-XiaoxiaoMultilingualNeural`

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to choose a Fish TTS voice?</summary>

Go to the [official website](https://fish.audio) to listen and choose the voice you want, and find the corresponding code for that voice in the URL, such as Ding Zhen is `54a5170264694bfc8e9ad98df7bd89c3`. Popular voices have been added to `config.yaml`. If you need to use other voices, please modify the `fish_tts.character_id_dict` dictionary in `config.yaml`.

<summary>GPT-SoVITS-v2 Usage Tutorial</summary>

1. Go to the [official Yuque document](https://www.yuque.com/baicaigongchang1145haoyuangong/ib3g1e/dkxgpiy9zb96hob4#KTvnO) to check the configuration requirements and download the integrated package.

2. Place `GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx` in the same directory level as `VideoLingo`. **Note that they should be parallel folders.**

3. Choose one of the following methods to configure the model:

   a. Self-trained model:
   - After training the model, `tts_infer.yaml` under `GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx\GPT_SoVITS\configs` will automatically be filled with your model address. Copy and rename it to `your_preferred_english_character_name.yaml`
   - In the same directory as the `yaml` file, place the reference audio you'll use later, named `your_preferred_english_character_name_text_content_of_reference_audio.wav` or `.mp3`, for example `Huanyuv2_Hello, this is a test audio.wav`
   - In the sidebar of the VideoLingo webpage, set `GPT-SoVITS Character` to `your_preferred_english_character_name`.

   b. Use pre-trained model:
   - Download my model from [here](https://vip.123pan.cn/1817874751/8137723), extract and overwrite to `GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx`.
   - Set `GPT-SoVITS Character` to `Huanyuv2`.

   c. Use other trained models:
   - Place the `xxx.ckpt` model file in the `GPT_weights_v2` folder and the `xxx.pth` model file in the `SoVITS_weights_v2` folder.
   - Refer to method a, rename the `tts_infer.yaml` file and modify the `t2s_weights_path` and `vits_weights_path` in the `custom` section of the file to point to your models, for example:
  
      ```yaml
      # Example configuration for method b:
      t2s_weights_path: GPT_weights_v2/Huanyu_v2-e10.ckpt
      version: v2
      vits_weights_path: SoVITS_weights_v2/Huanyu_v2_e10_s150.pth
      ```
   - Refer to method a, place the reference audio you'll use later in the same directory as the `yaml` file, named `your_preferred_english_character_name_text_content_of_reference_audio.wav` or `.mp3`, for example `Huanyuv2_Hello, this is a test audio.wav`. The program will automatically recognize and use it.
   - ⚠️ Warning: **Please use English to name the `character_name`**, otherwise errors will occur. The `text_content_of_reference_audio` can be in Chinese. It's still in beta version and may produce errors.


   ```
   # Expected directory structure:
   .
   ├── VideoLingo
   │   └── ...
   └── GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx
       ├── GPT_SoVITS
       │   └── configs
       │       ├── tts_infer.yaml
       │       ├── your_preferred_english_character_name.yaml
       │       └── your_preferred_english_character_name_text_content_of_reference_audio.wav
       ├── GPT_weights_v2
       │   └── [Your GPT model file]
       └── SoVITS_weights_v2
           └── [Your SoVITS model file]
   ```
        
After configuration, make sure to select `Reference Audio Mode` in the webpage sidebar (for detailed principles, please refer to the Yuque document). During the dubbing step, VideoLingo will automatically open the inference API port of GPT-SoVITS in the pop-up command line. You can manually close it after dubbing is complete. Note that the stability of this method depends on the chosen base model.</details>

7. For more advanced settings, you can manually modify `config.yaml`. Pay attention to the command line output during the running process.

## 🚨 Common Errors and Solutions

1. **'Empty Translation Line'**: This occurs when using a less capable LLM that omits some short phrases during translation. Solution: Please switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and try again.

2. **'Key Error' during translation process**: 
   - Reason 1: As above, weaker models may have issues following JSON format.
   - Reason 2: For sensitive content, the LLM may refuse to translate.
   Solution: Please check the `response` and `msg` fields in `output/gpt_log/error.json`.

3. **'Retry Failed', 'SSL', 'Connection', 'Timeout'**: These are usually network issues. Solution: For users in mainland China, please try switching to a different network node and retry.
